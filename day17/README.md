## Puzzle 01

Wrote a virtual machine in class `Computer`.  It maps opcodes to Ruby symbols
and then uses `#public_send` to invoke methods corresponding to each
instruction.  The instructions take care of moving the instruction pointer.  I
added traces to show the program executing and the machine's state after each
instruction.
